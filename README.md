# The web version of Deep Dream with InceptionV3 on Keras

A Flask / socket.io implementation of Keras deep dream, based on Fran√ßois Chollet's original [example](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/deep_dream.py). 

Note that I had originally written this demo app to run on Heroku but beware that it will not work well on a 512MB RAM dyno.
